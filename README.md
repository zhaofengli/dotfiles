# dotfiles
Just my opinionated dotfiles.

# Wat
* `fish`: Fishy stuff; Installs [fisherman](https://getcomposer.org/) and [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass), spices up the `PATH` a bit, and finally sets a bunch of (hopefully useful) abbreviations
* `vim`: Boring Vim stuff; Installs [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and some plugins
* `npm`: Configures `npm` to install global packages under `~/.npm-packages`
* `scripts`: Downloads [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* `ghc`: Sexy purple lambda prompt, and nothing more. No kidding.

# How
Make a recursive clone, run `install`, and marvel at the naivete of this setup.
